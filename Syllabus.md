COURSE TITLE

Introduction to C# Programming

DESCRIPTION OF COURSE

This class introduces the C# language including syntax and semantics, data types, control structures, functions, error handling and classes. 

Recommended prerequisite: COSC 1436.

OBJECTIVES

The student will develop a structured approach to solving problems using C#. The student will get practical experience buildings different types of applications in C# including Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation and ASP.NET. Additionally the student will get basic experience working with databases and XML.

UNITS OF INSTRUCTION

At the completion of the course, the student will:

1.	Design and develop C# programs using structured programming techniques.
2.	Have working experience using Windows Forms to create applications.
3.	Have working experience using WPF to create applications.
4.	Have working experience using ASP.NET to create applications.
5.	Be able to use ADO.NET to work with databases in an application.
6.	Be able to use LINQ to work with XML data in an application.
 
METHODS OF PRESENTATION

The instructional methods used will include reading; demonstrations; and laboratory assignments. 
 
EVALUATION

Grading formula:

5 Labs			= 60%
4 Quizzes		= 20%
	Final 			= 20%
	
Using the percentages from above, the final letter grade will be determined as follows:
	A: 90 – 100	B:  80 – 89	C: 70 – 79	D: 60 – 69	F: 0 – 59

•	This course is taught as a hybrid lecture/lab course. Students will be working on Students are expected to work on lab assignments outside of class.  When possible time in class will be made available to get assistance and work on labs.  Labs provide hands-on experience with programming.  Help is available through standard means as needed. 

•	All labs must be completed using Visual Studio 2017.  Students may either use their home computers or the lab computers as needed.

•	Assignments are due at the beginning of class on their due date.  Any special circumstances should be brought to the instructor’s attention prior to the beginning of class when the assignment is due.  Late assignments receive a 10 point deduction for each week thereafter.  The cut-off date for all assignments and makeup work is the weekend before final exams.

•	NO exceptions will be made for missed assignments because of the inability to install software, computer issues, corrupted files or incorrect submissions.  All students have access to the computer lab if they cannot use a home computer.

•	Students are expected to do their own work.  Any form of cheating will result in a grade of zero (0) for all those involved; disciplinary action by the College is also possible. Refer to the section on Original Work for more information.

REQUIRED RESOURCES
Murach’s C# 2015 (optional)
Author: Joel Murach and Anne Boehm, ISBN: 978-1-890774-94-3

Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
The free Community Edition is available from Microsoft.


SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

•	Each student will need a Github account (https://github.com) to store their work. Submissions will occur and be graded via Github.

•	Students are expected to read the chapter in the book before it is covered in class.  After covering the material in class students are expected to review the chapter and answer the questions to reinforce the topics.
	
•	Help is available during lab and office hours. After class help will be provided only if scheduled in advance.

•	Mobile devices such as cell phones, tablets and notebooks should be silenced while in class.  Devices may be used to take notes or view information related to the current class discussion.  Any devices that disrupt class or interfere with our students’ ability to learn in class should be turned off or left outside class.  If any such device is found during class then the student will be required to remove it from class. 

•	Attendance is taken at the beginning of class.  Any student not in class when attendance is taken is considered tardy.

•	A student in an on-campus course missing a cumulative of 15% of the class meetings and “at risk” of failing the course may be dropped at the discretion of the instructor.  An “at risk” student will receive communication from the instructor prior to any drop.  It is the responsibility of the student to work with the instructor to agree upon a contract for making up any work.  Failure to do so or failure to meet the contract requirements will result in a drop.

A student is considered “at risk” if any of the following apply

o	Have a current grade that is an F.
o	Have a projected grade that is an F.
o	Have missed more than half the labs and/or quizzes.

ORIGINAL WORK
All lab assignments are expected to be a student’s original work. For purposes of this course original work is defined as: code that is written by the student using the student’s own knowledge and understanding.

Students are encouraged to collaborate with other students and use online resources to find solutions but all submitted work must be written and understood by the student. The copying of code from online resources or other students and using as a student’s own is not considered to be original work.

For any assignment, the student may be called upon to explain the code that is written, discuss the rationale for writing of the code and/or possibly rewrite the algorithm without help from the code.
